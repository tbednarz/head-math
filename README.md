# quick-head-math

I created this app for anybody who has problems performing mental calculations
practice makes perfect!
Randomly generated numbers will be put on screen at a variable speed determined by the slider position
(1-10 seconds) 
Enjoy!

Will add support for all basic operators and variable speeds
